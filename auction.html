            <h2 class="section-title">Rules & Regulations</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Team Composition:</strong> Each team must consist of 3-4 members.</li>
                <li><strong>Initial Funds:</strong> Each team will be allocated a set amount of rupees to bid on candidates. No additional funds will be provided, so plan your strategy carefully.</li>
                <li><strong>Candidate Showcase:</strong> Candidates will be presented in a card format, displaying their role, experience, and base price. These cards will be revealed 1-2 days before the event to give teams ample time to strategize.</li>
                <li><strong>Live Auction:</strong> Bidding will take place in a live auction format. Each team must secure the minimum number of roles required to form a cohesive company.</li>
                <li><strong>Winning Criteria:</strong> The winning team will be the one that:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Acquires the minimum number of required roles.</li>
                        <li>Amasses the highest total credits from their selected candidates.</li>
                        <li>Constructs a well-structured company with a balanced and diverse set of roles.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Role Distribution:</strong> Teams must ensure a balanced distribution of roles within their company. Overlapping roles or missing essential roles will negatively impact the evaluation.</li>
                <li><strong>Funds Management:</strong> Teams must manage their allocated amount wisely. Exceeding the purse limit will lead to immediate disqualification.</li>
                <li><strong>Strategic Bidding:</strong> Teams should consider both the individual base price and the overall synergy of their company structure while bidding. A well-rounded team with complementary roles will outperform a team with high individual prices but poor cohesion.</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>Prepare for an epic battle of strategy and wit at the Asgardian Auction House, where only the most visionary team will claim victory!</p>
